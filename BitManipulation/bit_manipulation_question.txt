In a job interview focused on bit manipulation topics, you can expect a range of questions that assess your understanding of bitwise operations, binary representation, and related concepts. Here are some examples of questions that might be asked:

Basic Operations:

Explain the bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations.
How do you perform left and right shifts on binary numbers?
What is the result of XORing a number with itself?
Binary Representation:

How is a negative number represented in binary using two's complement?
Can you convert a decimal number to binary manually?
Explain the significance of the most significant bit (MSB) and least significant bit (LSB).
Bitwise Manipulation Techniques:

Write a function to set a specific bit in an integer to 1.
Implement a function to clear a specific bit in an integer.
Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.
Bitwise Tricks:

How would you check if a number is even or odd using bitwise operations?
Explain how to check if a particular bit is set in a given number.
Write a program to count the number of set bits (1s) in an integer.
Bitwise Shifts and Multiplication/Division:

Explain how left shifts and right shifts can be used for multiplication and division.
Write a function to multiply a number by 2 using bitwise operations.
Implement a division algorithm using bitwise operations.
Bitwise Operators in Programming Languages:

Discuss how bitwise operators are implemented in a specific programming language (e.g., C++, Java).
How does the language handle signed and unsigned integers in bitwise operations?
Applications:

Describe a real-world scenario where bitwise operations are useful.
How can bitwise operations be used for efficient coding in specific situations?
Error Detection and Correction:

Explain how bitwise operations can be used for error detection or correction.
Discuss the application of parity bits in data transmission.
